			<p class="gray">Although much of the flavor is determined first with choosing the tea, then with fermentation and the type of SCOBY, we finalize our product after the brewing process with a trade-secret for maximizing fizziness while creating a zing from the natural carbonation!</p>
			
			<p class="gray">Kombucha is the ideal 'detox' coupled with water. It is rich in many of the enzymes and bacterial acids your body produces and/or uses to detox your system, thus reducing your pancreatic load and easing the burden on your liver. Kombucha is also a great way to get a variety of quality nutrients like antioxidants, essential amino and organic acids, b-vitamins, polyphenols and probiotics.</p>
			
			<p class="gray">It is the absolute best substitute for every existing non-alcoholic drink at bars including all energy drinks, juices and sodas. In fact, not only is it a healthier substitute but it also cuts alcohol much better!</p>
			
			<p class="gray">Right now, we are offering Countertop System to deliver our Kombucha 5L keg on Draft to your venue -- ready to serve! Now that you are on-board, JOIN The Movement! We must share this consciousness with others; it's time to Drink to YOUR Health!</p>
